AIService manager for AI provider initialization

This module provides AIService instances with proper configuration
based on the current request's user settings.

In multi-user mode (when X-User-Token is present), each request gets
a fresh AIService instance with the user's own API key and settings.

Usage:
    from services.ai_service_manager import get_ai_service

    # In your controller
    ai_service = get_ai_service()
    outline = ai_service.generate_outline(project_context)
