## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the PPT is still blank; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, unable to flexibly adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making iterative changes difficult
- 3️⃣ Similar visual results, suffering from severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low material quality, lacking specificity
- 5️⃣ Fragmented text and image layouts, poor sense of design

These deficiencies make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core needs for PPT production: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are far from being "Vibe" enough in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts and strictly follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate aesthetic PPTs with zero barriers and no design experience, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Refer to AI-generated layouts and combinations of visual elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments and focus energy on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation to various scenarios.

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled text or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can choose a higher output resolution (OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating pages significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content to be rendered.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. You can refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Does it support the free tier Gemini API Key?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **Receiving a 503 error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed 503 error report; this is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key set in .env not taking effect?**
    - After editing `.env` during runtime, you need to restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If parameters were previously configured on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can use "Restore Default Settings" to revert to the `.env` settings.
